# Practice-Projects
These practice projects are to explore my knowledge and practice the use of systems like MySQL, Google Sheets, Vizualizations, Statistics, Custom Queries, 
Data Storytelling, and anything else that will provide value in the way of data analysis, specifically using large datasets. The projects range across 
industries and are related to my interests, for the most part.
